Mini_Download_Manager
=====================

A mini version of download manager using Java Swing, Java Multithread, and URL connection
Description: I’d like to have the program to arrange and manage the files that I downloaded. 
For that reason, this project is the mini version of internet download manager which is used to download, 
manage and delete the files from either the table or the hard driver. User can use this program to download, 
pause or resume files from the URL links, later if they don’t want these files, they can delete them directly
from the table. This project will get the URL link from URL textbox, then connect to its server
and read its content to an array, and then write the content of the array a file.
